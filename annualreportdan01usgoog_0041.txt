THE CHOICE OFA THEME 21

Dante followed scholastic Latin models. So he naturally did, als0, in his
three didactic Latin works: the broadly planned but unfinisfied book on
Vernacular Composiu'on3 the compact and well-rounded argument on
Alsonarchy3 the scientific lecture on the Problem os Water and Land.
The last two dealt with questions debated in his day -; but the first, the
Wmacular Composition, struck out in a new direction. Horace's Ars
Poetica (Aristotle's Poetzks was unknown) had to do with a very different
kind of literature3 the Rhetorics of Aristotle and Cicero scarcely touched
upon Dante's theme; the linguistic treatises, in the language of ‘southern
France, known as the Provenfal Donatus and the Explanation os Verse-
Making, merely grazed the subject3 the big Provencal compendium of
the art of versification, the Laws os Leve, was not yet written. In this
work, then, Dante showed himself an original investigator and a pioneer.

Our author has left us also some letters on various subjects, mostly
political; one, however, is a message of condolence‚ one a little introduc·
tion (apparently) to a canzone, and one (if it be his) accompanied the first
canto of the Paradae> sent to Can Grande dena Scala. This 1ast, which
is really a treatise of some length, deals with allegory, composition, and “
rhetoric. In these epistles — Cicero's letters being still inaccessible —
Dante followed the medieval style, with its pedantic language, violent
figures, and rhythmical cadenceS. He contrived, nevertheleSS, to put into
them something of his own. Two Latin eclogues complete the list of his
Latin works; these have to do with personal matters —— his preference
for Italian and his use of it in his great poem, and his reluctance to leave
Ravenna to visit Bologna, whither he was invited. The style is highly
figurative and allegorical, so much so that it is hard to tell what the
· author is talking about. His method is based evidently on a study of
Virgil's eclogues as they were interpreted in his day: namely, as poems
fundamentally and intricately symbolistic.

We corne now to Dante's great poem, the Divine Comedy, the book
which he knew to be his masterpiece, the crowning achievement of his
life, his title to immortality among men. Apparently he intended, from
the beginning, that his chief work should be a monument to the memory
of Beatrice; for at the close of the New Dfi2 after describing in a sonnet
the glory of his lady in Heaven, he proceeds to say: ³³ After this sonnet
there appeared to me a wondrous vision, in which Ι saw things that
made me determine to write no more of this blessed one until I should
