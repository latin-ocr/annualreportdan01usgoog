18 THE CHOICE OFA THEME

And therefore, doubting which my theme shall be,
1 fain would write, but know not what to say,
And thus in Love's bewildering maze am lost.
Would 1 agreement have, at any cost,
Mine enemy 1 needs must call and pray:
‘³ My lady Pity, come and comfort me! ’⁹
(T lte Ladies of Dante’s Lyrics, 26)

Often enough the Provencal and the Sicilian canso was frankly passion-
ate; and so are a few of Dante’s canzoni— particularly some of those
connected with Pietra — but apparently none of those associated with
Beatrice. Two conventional figures of the old canso -τὲ the jealous

husband and the informer— are absent from Dante.

No material or trivial details are to be found in his odeS, which keep
themselves in the realm of the abstract. In one poem (a sementen),
unfortunately lost but mentioned in the New Ltfis he did enumerate
³¹ the sixty most beautiful ladies '' of Florence; what his treatment of
the topic waS‚ we do not know. Possibly it was suggested to him by a
canso of Raimbaut de VaqueiraS, the ³¹ Chariot,” This poem tells how
all the ladieS, jealous of a certain Beatrice, resolve to wage war upon her,
but are ignominious'ly defeated; and there is a long list of the belligerent
ladieS. A similar enumeration occurs in the ³¹ Truce '' by Guilhem de la
Tor. Another Provencal causo may have suggested to Dante a theme
of a different type: Giraut de Bornelh relates that, following the song
of a bird, he comes upon three damsels weeping, who deplore with
him the depravity of the timeS. Similarly, Dante hears three ladies
mourning over the· degeneracy of the present day; but Dante's ladies
are allegorical.

Next to the cansa, among Provencal formS‚ may be placed the st'rventes,
a satirical or polemical or abusive poem written to an old tune. Some
of¹ the most spirited of them dealt with war. Here is a strophe of one
by Raimbaut de VaqueiraS, composed after he had received knighthood
from Boniface, Marquis of Monferrat, whom he accompanied on the
fourth Crusade to Constantinople:

Gallop and trot and leap and run,

N ight—watch and labor and distress
Henoeforth shall be my business;
Cold 1 'll endure, and scorching sun.
