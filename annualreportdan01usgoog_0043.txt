THE CHOICE OF A THEME 23

Comedy, he never mentions Beatrice in Hell. Supposing Dante had
never written the Commedia, the closing verses of our strophe would
naturally be understood as meaning simply that the poet (for 1 take the
‘³ some one '³ to refer to him) will proclaim his lady's name to the ends of
the universe, even to the depths of Hell. The poem is couched in a vein
of supreme hyperbole: Heaven is incomplete without Beatrice, the
angels are clamoring for her; her virtue awakens admiration on high;
Dante, who knows she is too pure for this world, will sound her praises
down⁸ below. We need not assume any real apprehension of an early
death for Beatrice — merely the general idea that earth does not deserve
to keep her. Still less need we understand (as some have done) that
Dante expects to' be damned; indeed, that possibility· is precluded ,by the τ
closing lines of the next stanza:

God granteth her a grace that ’s greater still:
Who speaks to her, escapes eternal ill.

Whether Dante, before the time indicated in the last chapter of the
New Ltfi, had any design of a supreme literary undertaking, remainS,
then, I think, an open question. Had he a plan or not, various possi-
bilities. were before him. Let us assume that, being a poet, he would
inevitably make his masterpiece a poem. In northern France there were
fine epics of war and chivalry, some of the stories of which, at least, had
reached Italy. Dante knew the romance of Lancelot of the Lake, 'the
book which Paolo and Francesca read together; in his Hell he refers to
the blow of King Arthur which slew the traitorous Mordrec; and in his
Paradioe he compares the indulgently rebuking smile of Beatrice to the
protesting cough of the Lady of Mallehault, at the interview of Lancelot
and Guinivere. He knew Tristan as a great lover. He knew Achilles in
the same role, and that hero's tragic end, as told in the Old French
romance of Troy. The Aliscans he knew, the epic of William of Orange.
And he knew how Roland blew his horn at Roncevaux. In De Vulgari
Eloquentia he speaks of F rench as the language of ¹³ histories of the
Trojans and Romans and the charming divagations of King Arthur.''
But he chose none of these themeS. The epics and romances of southern
F rance were probably unknown to him, but they would hardly have
appealed to him more than those of the north.

In northern F rance, in the thirteenth century, was produced that won-
