THE CHOICE OFA THEME 9

The man whom he calls father quakes in bed
For sear his robber son may lose his life
(His son no more than Christ was Joseph’s child l).
Of Bicci and his brothers it is said,
Each brings his booty to his brother’s wife:
Worthy descendants of a race defiled!
(Dante, 1 1 4-1 1 5)

At the opposite extreme in sentiment is a tenso in two stanzaS‚ by
Dante, on the occasion of> the death of Beatrice's father. This one is an
example of the fictitious dialogue‚ in which both parts are written by the
same author. The poet tells us that, as he was standing outside the house

of mourning, he watched the passage of ladies who had been within,
mourning with Beatrice3 and, overhearing scraps of their conversation,
he wove them into a speech supposed to be made by them in answer to

an imaginary question by him:

Dante to Ladies, O ye who walk with sels-forgetful mien,
With lowered eyes betraying hidden rue,
Whence corne ye, wearing pity’s very hue
And very look? Ah! tell, where have ye been?
Have ye perchance· diu-2 gentle Lady seen, . ·
With Love upon her face all bathed in dew?
Ladies, reply! My heart declares 't is true,
Beoeuse ye walk majestic, like a queen.
And if 'ye corne from such a piteousneSS,
1 pray you here a bit with me to bide
And how it fares with her, to me confess.
’ Your eyes cannot conceal that they have cried.
1 see you come, such pietures of distresS,
1 dare not think of what is prophesied.

Ladies to Dante. Art thou the man who oft hath been inclined

To sing of Her, addressing us alone?

His voice and thine, indeed, are like in tone,
And yet thy visage seems of different kind.
Alas! why weepest thou, so unresigned

That thou wouldst kindle pity in a stone?

Oh! hast thou listened to her piteous moan,
Who canst not now conceal thy sorrowing mind?

Leave tears to us, and sad funereal pace!
'T is sin to wish that we be comforted,
