of Love, whose code is there expounded. Snatched from danger by
ovid, purified by penance, he goes back to the wood in search of the
Liberal Arts. Many countries he crosses, never stopping until he rides
to the top of Mt. OlympuS, where he meets the venerable sage, Ptolemy.
Here the narrative breaks off. It is not a high flight of poetry, but it is

allegorical joumey. In this poem, the Tesoretto, we probably have one of
the first models for the Divina Comedy. Dante was certainly conscious
