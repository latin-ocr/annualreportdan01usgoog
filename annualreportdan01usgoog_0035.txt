THE CHOICE OFA THEME 15

Hard and distressful comoe my sighing breath
When thought recalleth to my heavy mind

The vanisht one by whom my heart was cleft;
And oftentimeS, as I reflee't on death,
So sweetly to its charm am I inclined,
1 yearn until 1 have no color left.
And when her image seeks my soul bereft,
Such pain on every hand assails me then,
1 shiver at the agonizing blow3
,My spirit sinks so low,
For 'very shame'l shun the sight of men.
Then, weeping‚ in my solitary woe
1 call on Beatrice: “Canst thou be dead! ”
And while 1 call on her, am comforted.

It closes with this envoy:

My piteous song, now go thy way in grief l
The maids and ladies find, on whom, in state,
Thy sisters used to wait,
With messages that always spake of gladness3

And thou, the youngest daughter, child of sadness,
Go forth to dwell with them, disconsolate.

A sonnet, and also a short canzone, of only two stanzaS, ‘³ Alasl when-
ever I recall to mind,'' Dante wrote— so he tells us — at the request of
a friend, a brother of his beloved, really for Beatrice but ostensibly on

the death of another lady. The sonnet, Wm'te a intender li sospin' miei,
runs thus:

Ο come and hear me utter sigh on sigh,
Ye gentle hearts, for pity wills it sol
O hear my sighs, which melancholy go!
And but for them, of sorrow 1 should dic;
Because my eyeS, however hard they try,
Could never pay their heavy debt of woe,
Mourning my love with such an endless fiow
My heart were oesed, tho' I should weep them dry.
Full often shall ye hear my sighs eittol
My gentle love, who hath her wings unfurled
To seek the Heaven her virtue hath deserved3
And ye shall hear thern oft condemn this world,
As doth my stricken, solitary soul, ‘
Forsaken by the blessed power it served.
