THE CHOICE OF A THEME 5

Joyous to see was Love, and he did keep
My heart within his hand, and in his arms
My Lady, lightly wrapt‚ in slumber deep.
Then on this burning heart‚ aroused from sleep,
He poorly fed her, deas to her alarmS.
And as he went away, I saw him weep. ·
(The Ladies os Dante’s Lyrics, 137-138)

This poem he sent ¹* to many who were famous composers at that
time,'' and answers carne ²³ from many people, and of different opinions3

· among which answerers was he whom Ι call the first of my friends, and

he then wrote a sonnet which begins ² All that is good, Ι think, hast thou
beheld.' And this was almost the beginning xof the friendship between
him and me, when he learned that I was the one who had sent it to
him.'' This “n first friend '' is Guido Cavalcanti, somewhat older than
Dante and already a man of considerable note. His reply is preserved,
as are two others: one by a minor poet named Dante da Maian03 one
sometimes ascribed to a lad who later became a great jurist and a close
friend of our author— Cino da Pistoia.

Now, when we look at Dante's verseS, we find in them, first, the idea
of a prophetie dream or vision, which is too general to point to a definite
model; it may be Biblical or classical. Then we see the figure of Love
as a god, common in the Provencal poetS‚ who derived it in the first
place from Ovid; Dante probably knew it in both sourceS. From either,
or from both, he may have got the sad note at the end—the expectation
of sorrow from love. More specific is the rather gruesome theme of a
lady compelled to eat her lover's heart‚ a legend told in various quarters
(not figuratively, as here, but literally), and attached especially to the
troubadour Guilhem de Cabestaing. The figurative devouring of a
heart occurs also in a striking poem by Sordell0, a famous Italian who
wrote in Provence, and who appears as a noble figure in the Divine
Comedy. Furthermore, there is in the Bible (Revelation x, 10) a pas-
sage that may have colored Dante's thought: “And Ι took the little
book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up3 and it was ·in my mouth
sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.''
The little p0em seems to indicate, then, familiarity with Provencal verse,
with the Bible‚ and perhaps with Ovid. These ,Dante ‘presumably knew 3v
and he must have known Virgil, the writer most studied in the schOOIS.'
