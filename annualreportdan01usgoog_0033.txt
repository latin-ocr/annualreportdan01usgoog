THE CHOICE OFA THEME 13

To Palestine he goeth,
He goes, my lover true;

And 1 (how grieved, God knoweth ἔ),
Whatever shall 1 do?

The Cross should bring salvation,
And nie it but dismays;
The Cross brings desolation:
1 envy him who prayS.
O pilgrim Cross, inhuman,
(Alasl these wretched days ἕ)
Why sacrifice poor woman?
My heart is all ablaze!

The Emperor, they tell me, ·
Keeps peace both far and near:

Then why should he compel me ·
To yield what 1 hold dear?

O mighty God above me,
Whom all the nations sear,

There is but one doth love me:
O bring him safely here!

1 ’ve told thee now, sweet poet,
Whereof to make a lay;

Let all the singers know it,
To Syria let it stray.

Sleep has forsook my pillow
Nor can 1 rest by day:

To lands beyond the billow
My lifefflas fied away.

Dante and his group favored neither of these last two themes3 they
ι wrote compianti only on death. Here is one by Dante, in sonnet form,
on the decease of a young friend of Beatrice:

Ye lovers, sigh! for Love, our Master, siglis,
Now learn what grief hath banisht all his glee:
Love heareth ladies calling piteously,

Their bitter pain revealing through their eyes·

‚Discourteous Death has set in cruel wise ’
Upon a noble heart his stern decree,
Destroying what in gentle ladies we,

Baeide their good repute, on earth do >prize.
