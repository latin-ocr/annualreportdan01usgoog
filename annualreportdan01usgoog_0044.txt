24 THE CHOICE OF A THEME

’ the Rose, at least the first part of which was known to his elderly adviser‚
Brunetto Latini, who had lived in Paris, But whether Dante himself
knew it, save by report, we oennot say. In his surely authentic works
there is no trace of it, unless the white rose of his Paradise be intended
as a counterpart of the red rose of the F rench romanoe. On the other
hand, there was made, in- his own time, an Italian abridged paraphrase
of the poem, in the form of a sonnet sequence, of such admirable work-
manship that some have attributed it to Dante himself. At any rate, he
did not select a similar theme for his masterpiece. With the drama,
religious and secular‚ which had developed in France‚ he shows no
acquaintance3 nor was he acquainted, it would seem, with the Romance
of Reynard the Fox3 nor with the pretty tale of Aucassin and Nicolette.
Nothing that he knew in French literature prompted him to imitation,
and no work on a large scale in the literature of Provence. .

This being the case, he might conceivably have turned to Latin.
Petrarch‚ a generation later, based his chief hope of fame on a Latin epic,
the Africa, dealing with Scipio Afrioeuus, Dante, t00, might have at·
tempted a history in ‘³ grammatical '' verse, on the pattern of Virgil or
Lucan. Possibly— since he perhaps had read some of Seneca's plays
— he might, like his contemporary and fellow-countryman Mussato, have
tried his hand at a Latin tragedy. But his ambition lay in another direc-
tion. Had he known them, some of the late and medieval Latin poets
—the allegorical ones— might have offered him a more congenial model:
PrudentiuS, with his Soul's Battle3 or Alanus de InsuIiS, with his Anti·
claudian and his Nature's Lament. For Dante loved allegory, and his
bent was strongly religious and didactic, His didactic impulse, so mani-
fest in the Banquet, led him to explore encyclopedic workS, from Pliny
through St. Isidore to the Treasure of his elderly friend, Brunetto Latini.

Now this same Brunett0, who, after a sojourn in F rance, spent the
latter part of his life in his native Florence, where he was a very promi-
nent citizen, wrote not only his Treasure in F rench prose (one of the
most highly prized of all encyclopedias)‚ but also a little Treasure in
Italian verse, which was a combination of instruction and allegory, and
was worked out, furthermore, in the form of a joumey. Lost in a strange
wood‚ the author, coming to his senseS, encounters the beauteous Darne
Nature, who bestows on him much precious information. After travers-
ing a wilderneSS‚ he reaches the Land of Virtue3 but, not content, he
