10 THE CHOICE OF A THEME

Since we have heard her speak with mournful grace.
Such sadness hovers plainly o’er her head
T hat who should try to look upon her face,
Weeping would sink to earth before her, dead.
(T lte Ladies qs Dante’s Lyrics, 115-116)

Of the fictitious tenso we have some unmistakable representatives in
Provencalz one is a dialogue between a noble poet and his horse;
another is a colloquy between a minstrel·monk and God. “

On the mourning women and the death of the father of Beatrice,
Dante has left us two other sonnets: the first, ‘³ Whence come ye here
so thoughtful and so sad ? '' contains the poet's question, without the
answer; the second, ‘¹ Ye ladies who your sympathy reveal,'' combines
inquiry and reply in one strophe. This theme brings us to another
literary type, the lament, called in Provencal planlz‚ in Italian compiantO.
Among the poets of Provence‚ and also among their Italian imitators, it
dealt with the death or departure of one's beloved or the death of a
patron or sovereign. The troubadours wrote several fine elegies on the
η passing of Richard Ι of England; the warlike Bertran de Born mourned
over ³¹ the young English King‚'' eldest son of Henry 113 an unknown
. poet deplored the loss of two young ladies who had entered a convent3
the death of Blacatz‚ a noble patron of letterS, called forth the best poem
of Sorde110. One of the singers of the Sicilian group, Giacomino Pugliese‚
has left us an elegy which begins thus:

Death, why dost thou afflict me with such pain,
Stealing my love, and with her all my mirth?

The flower of earthly beauty hast thou slain3
Now have 1 naught to live for, here on earth.

Discourteous Death, to treat my pleading so!

Thou ’st parted lovers, frozen pleasure's gIOW,

Till all is sad.
My former gayety is turned to woe,

For thou hast killed all comfort here below,
Which once I had.

Pleasure and sport and laughter once I knew
Better by far than any other knight;

But when my lady forth to Heaven flew,
Sweet hope went with her, and forsook me quite.
