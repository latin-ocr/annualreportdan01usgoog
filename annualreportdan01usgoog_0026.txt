6 THE CHOICE OF A THEME

There is more to be noted. Dante’s poem is a sonnet, a form unknown
to the poets of southern France‚ being an invention of the Sicilian School,
freely used, after the SicilianS, by the early songsters of Tuscany and
Bologna.

F urthermore, the sonnet by Dante and the responding sonnets of
other authors form together a composition termed in Provence tense, in
Italy (where it was imitated by the earliest writers) tenzone or contrastO.
It is a real· or fictitious debate between two or more poetS, in stanzas of
the same structure; among the ItalianS, the stanzas have always been
sonnets. Here are a couple of strophes of a Provencal tenso between
the famous troubadour Giraut de Bornelh and the scarcely less renowned
Count Raimbaut of Orange‚ nicknamed Linhaure, on the respective
merits of a clear and an obscure style:

0

Giraut de Bornelh, Ι would know
Why you persistently refuse
To praise th’ obscure style poets use.

Now tell me why

You glorify
A verse for which all men may oere:
Shall everybody have a share?

My lord Linhaure, even SO.
'T is right each one should have his views
And suit himself, but my poor muse
Knows well that 1
Amrated high
When I the easiest verse prepare.

To blame me, then, is hardly fair.
(Dante, 115-116)

It may be noticed that the rimes in the two stanzas are identical. This
was regularly the case in Provencal, and often in Italian, where the
practice of replying with the same rimes that were used by the first poet
was called ³² rispondere per le rime.''

As an example of a literary debate in early Italian we may take
an exchange of sonnets between Bonagiunta Orbiciani of Lucca and
Guido Guinizelli of Bologna, both of whom appear in the Divine Comedy,
the first as an inquirer into the new style, the second as Dante's master

in Italian verse.
