THE CHOICE OFA THEME 11

GrIef have 1 still, and endless ταῖς and sigh83
Society and sport and song and prize

Are all forbid.
No more 1 see her at my coming rise,

No more she turns upon me her sweet eyes,
As once she did.
(T he Ladies of Dante’s Lyrics, 6 5-66)

These Sicilian poets cultivated a special type of the¹ compiantoz the
lamentation of a lady forsaken by her lover. This theme, known as the
donna abbandonam, became very common in popular poetry, and, indeed,
perhaps came originally from folk-song into the literary repertory. No
doubt there was popular song of some kind in those early days3 but, as
it was not written down, we can only guess what it was like. That is
why we cannot‘ be sure, concerning certain themeS, whether they origi-
nated with the unlettered rustics or with the oourtly poets. The following
example, by Odo delle Colonne, certairssy suggests a strain of the people's
muse. The woman speaks:

Ah mel to love in vain!

Now tell onoe more, my song,
Again and yet again,

How days and nights are long
And life is naught but pain,

Tho’ 1 have done no wrong.

There ’s one who ’s all to me,

And he was mine before,
But now he will not be.

Ah! who could suffer morel
He treats me haughtily:

My heart is crusht and sore.

Alas! what have 1 done?
Love will not let me go:

His image lures me on,
Which hath enslaved me 80.

Since his fair face is gone,
No gladness do 1 know-
