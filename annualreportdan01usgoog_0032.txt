12 THE CHOICE OFA THEME

1 hold no joy in fief3

Love grants me only hate
And everlasting grief.

Ο Death, be not too late!
,Corne now to my relief

And save me from this state! >

Ah me! why did he say,

When no one else was nigh:
“ Richly dost thou repay3

Thy love 's a prize so high,
I’d not give it away

For earth and stars and sky ’Ἴ

And now (ingratitude ἔ)

He scorns me, and begins ,
On other thoughts to brood.

Ο Godl may she who wins
My love from her he wooed

Perish with all her sins!

Go forth, my little song,

To fortune's favored son3
And if he do me wrong,

Strike him, the guilty one—
But not with blow too strong,

Lest he be sore undonel

But strike and surely slay

Her who usurps my place.
Then will he find his way

To rne, with smiling face,
N ever again to stray.

Joy will be mine, and grace!

A variant of the type is the plaint of a woman whose lover has departed
on a Crusade. Once, at least, the theme was treated in Proveneal, in a
poem by Marcabru. The Sicilians were successful in it, as may be seen
from the following compmnto by Riualdo α’ Aquino 2'

Sweetness is turned to oenker
And joy is turned to rue:

The ships are weighing anchor, -
They ’ll soon be on the blue.
