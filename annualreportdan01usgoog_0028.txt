8 THE CHOICE OF A THEME

Emperor F rederick II; Giacomo da Lentini, leader of the Sicilian School,
called by Dante (and often by himself) ³² the Notary.'’ Sometimes
the tenso ran into scurrilous abuse, as in a certain poetic dialogue be·

tween the popular troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras and the marquis ι

Albert Malaspina, a member of a family that a century later entertained
Dante. Although the tone of the poem is scandalouS, the. intention was
probably comio. Such, too, I think, was the intent of a sonnet-dialogue
between Dante and his friend Bicci Junior, or F orese Donati, a kinsman
of the lady whom Dante afterwards married. In the first sonnet, Dante
makes fun of Bicci's wife and her continual coldS, due to her husband's
desertion; in the second, Bicci tells how, at daybreak, he went out to
dig for hidden treasure in the graveyard and met there the ghost of
Dante's father. Then Dante charges his friend with gluttony‚ which has
brought him to ruin. Bicci replies: ⁸

Give back your borrowed clothing to St. Gall,
Before you sneer at other people’s droes.
This winter many men are in distresS‚

For you have fairly stript their hospital.

And if our poverty is comical,

Please send'to us for food a little less.
From Altafronte you get many a mess,

Enough to stuff you like a cannibal.

If you have Frank and Tana to support
(God give them health ἔ) you shall have work to spare;

For with Belluzzo you have naught to do,

Our hospital shall be your last resort:

I see you now in gay apparel there
At paupers’ table, with the other tw0.

And Dante retorts ε

Bicci the Son (whose son, no one could say,
Unless his mother, Monna Tessa, could)
Has stowed away so much expensive food

That other people’s money has to pay.

And men with gold about them will not stay,
Crying, when he comes nearer than he should:
‘² That fellow‘with the broken face is good

At picking pockets; let us edge away! ”
