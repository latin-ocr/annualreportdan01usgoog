be able to great of her more worthily. And to that end I am studying
with all my might, as she truly knowS. Wherefore, if it shall be the
pleasure of Him by whom all things live, that my life endure for some
yearS, I hope to say of her what never was said of any woman.'' It is
(let us say) the year 1294; the place is Florence. Here weqhave a man
twenty-nine years old, of considerable reading, who has won distinction
as a lyric poet, and who feels himself capable of far higher flights in
literature. What theme shall be chosen by such a man? What theme is
best adapted to satisfy his own artistic ambition and to perpetuate the
name of his beloved, now a blessed soul in Paradise? What was the
³³ wondrous vision '' that flashed upon him, after he had composed the last
sonnet of the New Life?

Some there are who think that Dante had selected his subject years
before, when he wrote ‘³ Ladies who have intelligence of love,'' the first
ode of the New Ltfi, and the first poem of any kind after his conversion
to platonic love and the ³¹ sweet new style.'' Now there is some⁴ ground

or twenty-three. The second stanza of the ode runs as follows:

An angel in the mind of God doth call,
Saying: “ O Lord, on earth there meets our eyes
A wondrous virtue which doth hither rise,
Forth from a soul whose light doth climb anear.”
And Paradise, which lacketh naught at all
Save only h'er, unto its Maker cries—
And every saint— to bring her to the skies.
Pity alone our earthly plea doth hear3
For God declareth of my Lady dear:
“ In peace, beloved spirits, suffer still
That she for whom ye hope await my will
Below, where some one her release doth sear,
One who shall say in Hell: ‘ Ο souls distrest, ο
Mine eyes have seen the hope of all the blest.’ ”

E che dira nell' Inferno: O malnati,
Io vidi la speranza de' beati.
(T he Power of Dante, 192)
