16 · THE CHOJCE oF A THEME

Another compz'anto on the loss of Beatrice was written by Dante's friend,
Cino da Pistoia, who composed one also on the death of the Emperor,
Henry VII, whom Dante so admired.

But enough has been said to show how Dante selected and adapted
to his purpose two of the conventional types of Provencal and early
Italian literature: the tense, or discussion, and the plank, or elegy. The
former he used for amatory, funereal,· and humorous themes; the latter
he restricted to one function — lamentation over the death of a lady.
What were the other lyric themes and forms current in the literature of
southern France? The balada, or ballad, — a dance-song' actually per-
formed by dancing ladieS, — usually treated, in Provence, some light or

realistic love theme ; Dante made it the vehicle of delicate sentiment and
dainty conceitS, as in this little poem:

Chorus. Ah! Violet, which once didst meet mine eyes,
Shadowed by Love, appearing suddenly,
Pity the heart which wounded was by thee,
Which hopes in thee, and, yearning for thee, dies.

Solo, Thou, Violet, in beauty past belief,

With fatal words didst kindle in my mind
A furious fire, the while

Thou, like a blazing spirit swift and kind,

Didst fashion hope, which partly cures my grief,
Whene’er 1 see thee smile.
Ah! scorn me not, tho’ 1 myself beguile!
Think of the longings which within me burn!
For many a bygone maid, tho' slow to turn,

H ath felt at last the pain she did despise.

Chorus. Ah! Violet, which once didst meet mine eyeS,
Shadowed by Love, appearing suddenly,
Pity the heart which wounded was by thee,
Which hopes in thee, and, yearning for thee, dies.
(The Ladies of Dante’s Lyn'cs, 4)

For the serious expression of love the poets of the Mida· had the canso',
their principal lyric form, which in Italian was called canzone. Of course
there is much variety in' elaborating the theme; but we may say, in
