“ IL CHI E IL QUALE” 3

In view of the distinetion so clearly made in this chapter between the
two types of nobility possessed by AEneaS, and the extensive treatment
of each, it seems to me evident that when Dante wrote the words
‘³ il chi e il quale '' he had in mind the same distinction; that by the
words ³³ il chi '' he meant to suggest the nobility of AEneas by inheritance;
and that by the words ³¹ il quale '' he meant to suggest the nobility of
AEneas in persona] qualitieS.

Just as ³³ l' alto effetto ch’uscir dovea di lui '' refers to the descendants
of AEneaS‚ so ³³ il chi '' refers by irnplication to those from whom he
derived inheritance, and ³³ il quale '’ refers to the man himself. The two
lines constitute another of Dante's swift surveys of past, present, and
future.
⁴ The phrase ‘² il chi e il quale ” thus affords a notable instance of
Dante's habit of endowing common words with rich and specific meaning.
