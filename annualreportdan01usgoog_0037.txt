THE CHOJCE OF Α THEME 1 7

general, that the Provencal conception of it is feudal — the lady being
regarded as a superior, an absolute sovereign, the lover as a vassal.
This convention was ordinarily followed by the earliest Italian amatory
poetS. But with Guido Guinizelli of Bologna there came a change:
with him, the conception of love is no longer feudal, but religiouS. The
lady is still a superior, but not an earthly one ε she becomes a symbol of
the angelic nature, the heavenly intelligence 3 *and the lover exchanges the
position of vassa] for that of worshiper. This attitude may be illustratcd
by a stanza from Dante's first canzone in the ‘³ sweet new style ''—
“ Ladies who have intelligence of love '' :

My lady 's longed for in the heavens above.
Now let me tell you of her wondrous might.
Whatever lady would be “ gentle ” hight
Should walk with her3 for when she goes her way,
⁴A chill is cast on vulgar hearts by Love,
And all their thoughts are cold and dead with fright.
Whoe’er should stand his ground to see the sight
Would be ennobled or would turn to clay.
When she discerns a worthy man who may
Rightly behold her, he must own her power3
For blessedness she gives, a mystic dower,
So humbling him, no spite oen with him stay.
God granteth her a grace that ’s greater still:
Who speaks to her, escapes eternal ill.
⁶ ( T lte Ladies of Dante’s Lydes, 21-22)

Not all of Dante's amatory poetry is in this vein.⁹ In fact, an interest-
ing passage in the New Ltfe tells of his conversion. His previous style
differs not only in its more worldly conception of the lady, but also in
the prominence of the author's sels: ’

Of Love within me speaketh every thought;
And yet they show so much variety
That one doth make me crave his tyranny‚
Another reckons all his power as naught‚
Another, hopeful‚ sweetness may have brought,
Another makes me weep full frequently.
Only agreed in asking sympathy, 2.
They quake with fear, by which the heart is caught.
