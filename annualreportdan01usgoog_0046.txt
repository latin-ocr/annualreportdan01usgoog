26 THE CHOICE OFA THEME

yet found the real spirit, the soul of Dante's theme. The Divine Comedy,
like the New Lzse, is first and foremost a psychic autobiography; -it is a
record of awakening from sin, of remorse, of reformation, of discipline,
of purification, of religious contemplation, and of union of the soul with
God. Had Dante a model for a work of this nature? He had; and
he names it in his Banquet, in the passage which states the conditions
under which it is legitimate to speak of one's self. ³³ The second,'' he
says, “is when, by talking of one's sels, very great assistance is rendered
to others in the way of teaching. And this reasonimpelled St. Augustine
to speak of himself in his Confessi0n53 for in the progress of his life,
which was from bad to good, from good to better, and from better to
best, he has given us an example and a lesson, which else could not have
been had from so true a witness.''

Inwardly a spiritual confession, outwardly an allegorical journey in the
form of a vision, with much incidental doctrine, the Commedia blend‘s
these several types into one, and a new theme is created — a theme
which the poet clothes with all the splendors of language and imagination.
Truthfully could Dante say, in his Paradzke:

L' acqua che io prendo giammai non si corse.
