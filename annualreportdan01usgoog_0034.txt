14 THE CHOICE OFA THEME

What honor Love bestowed on her, now guess!
1 saw his very sels lamenting there
Over the charming form that lifelcss lay,
Lifting his mournful gaze to Heaven alway,
Which had become the gentle soul’s repair
That once was queen of all in joyousneSS.
( T lte Ladies os Dante’s LyricS, 66)

Another poem by the same author on the same subject is full of con-
ceitS, and is written, aISO, in an expanded and difficult form of the sonnet
known as the sonetto n’nterzato:

Ο mean, ungentle Death, sweet pity’s foe,
Old ancestor of woe,
Inevitable sentence, and malign!
Since thou hast stricken so this heart of mine
That 1 must ever pine,
Blame thee 1 must, till tongue shall weary grOW.
Would 1 make thee for mercy begging g0‚
To all the world I’d show
That one supremely sinful sin of thine3
Not that the world hath seen thereos no sign,
But rather to incline
To wrath all those the food of Love who know.
By thee our life is robbed of courtesy
And all the goodness we to woman trace3
Youth's joyous face
Hath lost its loving charm because of thee.
I will not tell who may this lady be,
Save by her virtues known in every place.
Unless one merit grace,

One never must expect such company.
(T lte Ladies of Dante’s LynZw, 63-64)

In the sixty years or so that intervened between the invention of
the sonnet and Dante's first use of it, the form had undergone many
variations; and it is noteworthy that our poet, after his earliest period,
should have preferred the simpler, more primitive types, of fourteen lines,
Of the first four sonnets in the Ncw Lg'fe, two are sonetti n‘nterzati3 but
we never find in the little book this intricate variety again. Several ele·
gies in plain sonnet form Dante wrote on the death of his Beatrice, and
one in the form of a canzone, or ode, ‘³ My eyes in sorrow for my heart's
distress.’' Here is one stanza of this last poem:
