THE CHOICE OF A >THEME1

ΒΥ C. H. GRANDGAENT

Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus; et versate diu, quid ferre recusent

Quid valeant humeri. . ’ -
Α Horace, Epistola ad Pisones, 38-40

· “- Before all things„'' declares Dante in his treatise On· Vernacular
Compositibn, ³¹ before all things it behooves everyone to adapt to his own
shoulders the weight of his theme, lest one be forced to stumble into the
mire, because the strength of his shoulders is overladen. That is what
our master Horace counseIS, when he says at the beginning of his Poetics:
² choose your theme.' ''- It is not without interest to ask what Dante had
to choose from, when he started his literary career. What possibilities
were suggested to him by the literature he knew? To answer this ques-
tion, we must ask another: what literature did he know in the years when,
having studied out for himself the art of verse-making, he began to corn-
pose songs of his own? His earliest poem, as far as we are aware, is
that first sonnet of the Ne'w Life, written when he was seventeen and,
having received a greeting from Beatrice, became conscious of love:

On every captive soul and gentle heart
Before whose eyes the present screed may g0‚
Greetings from Love, their master, 1 bestOW,
And beg, their judgment they to me im'part.
Of all the time when stars display their art
The hours bethirded were, or nearly SO,
When Love appeared before me, nothing sloW.
At thought of him Ι still with horror start!
